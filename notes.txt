we used averaging technique to blur out the image.
with kernal of 3x3 metrics containing all ones.
the more you increase filter size the more average
and the more image will  be blured.
then perfom normalization else the image will be
white.

low pass blur image
high pass sharp the image


Motion bluring
values gets blur in particular direction.
A directional low pass filter, by averging the values
in horizontal direction.
horizonally dizzy

box filter to increase the intensity of image, to
make it brighter

gaussian blur is far better,  
contrast values good, color maintained

median blur: replaces pixel value with the median
of all values laying in kernel area(beautify).
it is best for noise

bilateral: reduction of noise + preserving the edges
